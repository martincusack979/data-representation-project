## Introduction

**How to use this repository**

1. Install latest version of Anaconda.
2. Install the latest version of Visual Studio Code.
3. Clone the repository at https://github.com/martincusack979/data-representation-project
4. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code.
5. Run using Python interpreter 3.9.18.

### This repository contains: 
1. A folder entitled **dvds_Database_files** containing all the Python files used in setting up the database for the project.
2. A folder entitled **HTMLfiles**  containing all the individual HTML and Javascript files which were created for the project.
3. A HTML file entitled **dvdViewer.html** containing HTML and Javascript used in creating my **DVDs** web page, and also containing all
 the AJAX requests required to interact with the API.
4. A Python file entitled **dvds_server.py** which contains the Flask server which was created for the project. The server
 provides a RESTful API which performs CRUD operations on DVDs.
5. An **images folder**.
6. A .gitignore file and a readme file.

I decided to choose the type A, or simple, project option.  I went with this option mainly because so much of the content in the module was quite new to me 
(I had not taken the "Applied Databases" or "Web Aplications" modules before because I had deferred these and will be taking them in the Spring 2024 semester).  For this reason, I decided to choose the simpler option so that I would not be overloaded with too much new material which I was not familiar with.
