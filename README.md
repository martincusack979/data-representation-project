This repository contains: 
1. A folder entitled *dvds_Database_files* containing all the files used in setting up the database for the project.
2. A folder entitled *HTMLfiles*  containing all the individual HTML and Javascript files which were created for the project.
3. A HTML file entitled dvdViewer.html containing HTML and Javascript used in creating my web page, and also containing all the AJAX commands required to interact with the API.
4. A Python file entitled dvds_server.py which contains the Flask server whoch was created for the project.
5. An images folder, a .gitignore file and a readme file.

I decided to choose the type A, or simple, project option.  I went with this option mainly because so much of the content in the module was new to me (I had not taken Applied Databases or Web Aplications before, I had deferred these and will be taking them in the spring 2024 semester).  For this reason, I decided to choose the simpler option so that I woudl not be overloaded with too much new material which I was not familiar with.
